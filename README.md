# pyfit

**pyfit** is a simple Machine Learning library built with Python and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for educational purposes.

## Overview

This project's main goal is to help ML students and enthusiasts get a deeper understanding of the Machine Learning workflow and main algorithms, by implementing them from scratch.

As a Python package, it also strives to define a clean, pythonic API and follow good coding practices. It uses [type annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for linting and [pytest](https://pytest.org) for testing.

## Features
